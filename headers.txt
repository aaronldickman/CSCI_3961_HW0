Request Headers
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.26.10
Essentially a fingerprint of the browser or program that is sending the request, containing info like what program and what version number of the program is sending the request.

Accept: */*
What content types the client can understand. In this case it accepts any content type.

Postman-Token: e97e8142-dd8c-4097-94fd-b5a0cc6676bc

The host and port to which the request is being sent

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
What encoding/compression algorithms the client can understand.

What the format of the returned content is.

Vary: Origin
Vary: X-Origin

What the encoding/compression of the content returned is.
